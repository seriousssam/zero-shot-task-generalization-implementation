# Zero-shot Task Generalization: implementation with a new environment

## Status
The code and pdf for this project is work in progress.

## Intro
Project conducted with Chao Yu for Prof. Michael Yip's class Robot Reinforcement Learning (ECE 276C).

This project consists in:
1) A new simple maze-like game environment that can be used for reinforcement learning with task-generalization (loosely based on the environment described in Oh et al)
2) An implementation of Oh et al's paper: "Zero-Shot Task Generalization with Multi-Task Deep Reinforcement Learning" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05064) -- which does not have published code.

## To do

- Continue the explanation on this README
- Add the code after cleaning it a bit
- Add gifs and/or images
- Add pdf report
